# Knights_Travails

Second Data Structures and Algorithms Project within TOP's Ruby Programming Unit. Building a program that finds and shows the simplest path a knight can take from one path to another on a chess board. This program takes in two coordinate inputs (starting square, ending square), and displays the path from start to end on a chess board for the user to see!

Thoughts:

- Think I've learned the proper approach to solving a problem with a more complex data structure. At first, I spent a ton of time working on building a graph class, 
  thinking that once I had a good graph class, I'd be able to solve the problem easily. After struggling with that approach for much too long, I took a new
  approach, analyzing the specifics of the problem first, which led me to realize that a queue would be a much more appropriate structure for the problem. I'm 
  finding that when I spend more time thinking and mapping out problems, the solutions come much faster. Who would've thought it.
